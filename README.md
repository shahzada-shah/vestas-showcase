## Introduction
The Vestas Showcase project is a remarkable demonstration of the capabilities of renewable energy. Leveraging the power of React, Tailwind CSS, and various icon libraries, we have created an immersive and visually captivating web application. Our project, Vestas Showcase, aims to provide users with an engaging platform to explore and discover the extensive range of Vestas products.

### Key Features 
* **Dynamic Filtering:** The application incorporates a dynamic filtering feature that allows users to refine their search for Vestas products based on specific criteria such as wind class, platform, and rated power.
* **Loading State Optimization:** To enhance the user experience, the application implements a loading state optimization. This feature ensures that users are presented with smooth transitions and feedback during data retrieval or filtering operations.
* **Context and State Management:** The use of React's Context API and state management (useState) allows for efficient data handling and sharing among components. This ensures consistent data synchronization and enables interactive functionality.

## Future Updates or Improvements
* **Auth Login/Sign Up:** Introduce an authentication system that enables users to create an account, log in, and access personalized features. This will enhance user engagement and allow for personalized experiences, such as saving favorites or accessing exclusive content.
* **Turbine Model Page for Each Turbine:** Develop dedicated turbine model pages that provide detailed information about each turbine. These pages can include specifications, performance data, visual representations, and user reviews. This will provide users with comprehensive information to evaluate and compare different turbine models effectively.
